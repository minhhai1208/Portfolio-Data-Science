# Data Science Portfolio – Minh Hai Tran

Welcome to my **Data Science Portfolio**, a collection of projects that showcase not only my technical skills but, more importantly, how I **apply data science to real-world problems**.  

While a strong understanding of theory is essential, I believe that **the true value of data science lies in its application**. Concepts alone do not solve problems—**building working solutions that deliver insights and impact is what drives me**.

### SVD Image Compression GUI – [Click here for more details](https://github.com/minhhai1208/SVD-with-GUI)

- **Description**: Interactive GUI to upload an image and reconstruct it using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**. Users can choose **rank-based** or **error-based** approximation and visualize results in real-time.  
- **Tech stack**: Python, Tkinter, NumPy, PIL, imageio. 
- **Key learning/skills demonstrated**: Low-rank matrix approximation, memory-efficient data representation, GUI development, image processing.

## Side Projects

- ### Computer Vision (CNN)
    - [Hand Language Classification](https://github.com/minhhai1208/handLanguageClasstification/tree/main)  

      A project to classify hand gestures from images. After experimenting with traditional feature-based preprocessing (**HOG, DCT, DWT**) and achieving modest results, I implemented a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with data augmentation**, which achieved **nearly 100% accuracy** on both training and test sets.  

      Highlights my skills in **deep learning, image preprocessing, and robust model development**.
