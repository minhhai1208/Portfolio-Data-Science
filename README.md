# Data Science Portfolio – Minh Hai Tran

Welcome to my **Data Science Portfolio**, a collection of projects that showcase not only my technical skills but, more importantly, how I **apply data science to real-world problems**.  

While a strong understanding of theory is essential, I believe that **the true value of data science lies in its application**. Concepts alone do not solve problems—**building working solutions that deliver insights and impact is what drives me**.

## Side Projects

- ### Computer Vision
    - Hand Language Classification - [Click here for more details](https://github.com/minhhai1208/handLanguageClasstification/tree/main)  

      A project to classify hand gestures from images. After experimenting with traditional feature-based preprocessing (**HOG, DCT, DWT**) and achieving modest results, I implemented a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with data augmentation**, which achieved **nearly 100% accuracy** on both training and test sets.  

      Highlights my skills in **deep learning, image preprocessing, and robust model development**.
      
- ### Natural Language Processing
    - Email Spam Classification Using CNN - [Click here for more details](https://github.com/minhhai1208/spamEmailDetection)  

      This project detects spam messages in Email data using a **1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. After cleaning and tokenizing text, I handled class imbalance with **SMOTE** and trained a CNN with **embedding, convolution, pooling, dropout, and batch normalization layers**.  

      The model achieved **high accuracy** on both training and test sets, highlighting my skills in **deep learning for NLP, text preprocessing, and handling imbalanced datasets**.  

    - storyGenerator Using LSTM - [Click here for more details]("https://github.com/minhhai1208/storyGenerator/tree/main")
       This project trains a **word-level LSTM model** on the text of *Alice in Wonderland* to generate new story sequences.  
  Starting with random words, the model learns the style, structure, and word dependencies of the original text.  
  It demonstrates skills in **sequence modeling, embedding layers, LSTM training, and text generation** using PyTorch.
